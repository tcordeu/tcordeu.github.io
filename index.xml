      <description>Hi! I am Thomas a DevOps from Buenos Aires, Argentina mainly focused on Kubernetes. I have proven experience designing and implementing production-grade clusters.
Aside from my DevOps work, I used to be a fullstack developer (AngularJS + Ruby on Rails) and I am close to finishing my computer science degree at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA).
On my off-time, I play football (soccer in the US) and I try to contribute to Kubernetes related open source projects such as cluster-api.</description>
